Explain what is meant by the syntax and the semantics of a programming language. 
Give Java examples to illustrate the difference between a syntax error and a semantics error. Use different examples than those found in the textbook. 

Your Discussion should be at least 250 words in length, but not more than 750 words. 
Once youâ€™ve completed your initial post, be sure to respond to the posts of at least 3 of your classmates


The syntax of a programming language describes which strings of characters comprises a valid program. It refers to the rules and regulations for writting any statement in a programming language. 
It does not have to do anything with the meaning of the statement.
A statement is syntactically valid if it follows all the rules. 
It is related to the grammer and structure of the language. 

Semantics refers to the meaning associated with the staement in a programming language. 
It is all about meaning of the statement which interprets the program easily. 
Errors are handled at runtime

Examples of syntax errors include:

1. ';' expected

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("My name is Rafael")
	}
}



2. Incompatible types 

public class Main {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String name = "Odun Smith"
		int a = 5.5
		
		System.out.println("Your name is " + name)
	}
}

Examples of Semantic errors include

public class TotalProfit {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int amount1 = 250; 
        	int amount2 = 400;

        	System.out.println("The total profit is  $" + (amount1 * amount2));

	}

}

# This program will output The total profit is $100000. This is incorrect; the expected output is $650. 
This happens because we use a multiply (*) sign instead of an addition (+) sign.
