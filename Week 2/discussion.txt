Use your examples to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of each looping structure, and describe those advantages and disadvantages.

for loop:
Initialization can either be in loop statement or outside the loop.
It is best used when the number of iterations is known.
A for statement provides a shorter, simpler to debug looping structure.

while loop:
Initialization is always outside the loop.
It is works best for complex initialization.

do while loop:
it checks for the condition after executing the statements.
Statement(s) is executed atleast once, thereafter condition is checked.
